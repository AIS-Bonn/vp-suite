class FrechetVideoDistance(BaseMeasure):
    r"""
    This measure calculates the Frechet Video Distance, as introduced in Unterthiner et al.
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01717). The Frechet Distance is a similarity measure between two curves,
    and the Frechet Video Distance transfers this idea to assess the perceptual quality of generated videos with
    respect to a ground truth sequence by comparing video features obtained by passing the videos to an InceptionI3D
    Network.

    Code is inspired by: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.8/tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/eval/python/classifier_metrics_impl.py

    Note:
        The Frechet Video Distance calculation code is differentiable, meaning that this version of FVD can also be
        used as a loss!
