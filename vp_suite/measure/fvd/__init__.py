This module contains trained models reported in the paper "Quo Vadis,
Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics
Dataset" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750) by Joao Carreira and Andrew
Zisserman.

The code of the private module '_pytorch_i3d' is based on Deepmind's Kinetics-I3D
(https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d).
